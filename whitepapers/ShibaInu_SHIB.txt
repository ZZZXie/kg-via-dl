SHIBA INUECOSYSTEMWWW.SHIBATOKEN.COMBONEv1 - 4/29/21 - WOOF PaperINTRODUCTIONOur journey was the answer to a simple question.What would happen if a cryptocurrency project was 100% run by its community?While the term DeFi literally includes the word decentralized, this is in reference toeconomic status as opposed to its internal hierarchy. Our founder, Ryoshi, said this ofour beginnings, “We are an experiment in decentralized spontaneous communitybuilding(...)”While none of us could have imagined it at the time, this was a concept that would starta revolution.Projects built on the foundation of community involvement are the untamed wildernessof our future. As we move further away from rigid financial structures and traditionalmindsets, we become free to discover new ways to solve problems and relate to oneanother.In a world ruled by the commodification of time, community-run projects are more thanjust a change of pace, they are a way to practice the radical acceptance of others.When success depends on the shared strength of the individuals who make up acollective, we are forced to shift our perspectives to align with those around us. TheShiba Inu Ecosystem is our way of recognizing the importance of tearing down thislong-established paradigm.A community is held together by hundreds, if not thousands, of interconnectedmoments. By studying those drawn to our project, we realized that true strength doesn’tcome from one of us alone, it comes from when we work together in harmony.With that thought bright in our minds, we began developing the Shiba Inu Ecosystem inearnest.v1 - 4/29/21 - WOOF Paper WWW.SHIBATOKEN.COMWHYDECENTRALIZATION?We are standing at a pivotal moment in innovation.Until now, centralization has been a prerequisite for all of our o􀆕icial structures.Political, educational, and financial systems are, and have always been, crafted ina way that does not equally and ethically distribute power to those functioningwithin them. There have been times in our history where this sort of internalstructure played an important role, but in an age with the information of the worldavailable at the click of a button, it’s time to rethink.2021 opened our eyes to how little control the average person has in the face ofthese overarching, generational structures when GameStop and AMC stock valueexploded seemingly overnight. WallStreetBets tested the waters of what it wouldlook like to disperse control to consumers and inexperienced investors alike.It was inspiring, but it didn’t last long. Just when the movement seemed to be onthe brink of success, it was throttled by the bureaucracy of our centralized society.However, not before this concept of a new power among the people took root.Months before any of these events made international news, Ryoshi was alreadysetting his 100% community-based, cryptocurrency experiment into motion.Cryptocurrency itself comes from the idea of redefining wealth and how it can beacquired, which goes against traditional processes by its very nature. And yet,most, if not all, cryptocurrencies function within enforceable rules. It’s easy to seewhen we look back at cases like the SEC’s win over the Kin Ecosystem (acentralized authority), or when we consider how the Binance Smart Chain seems touse centralized authority to o􀆕er “benefits” over their decentralized partnerships.v1 - 4/29/21 - WOOF Paper WWW.SHIBATOKEN.COMIn the ever-shifting economic landscape, cryptocurrencies which do not take theirindependence into their own hands struggle with a tenuous existence.When the rules of the game are changed against their favor, they have no optionbut to comply; regardless of the consequences.Ryoshi approached the creation of our community from a unique perspective.“We believe through the power of collective decentralization we can buildsomething stronger than a centralized team ever could create.A community-run token is nothing without the united individuals who give itpurpose.”From the early days of Shiba, we became known as the Shib Army, both amongstourselves and across the countless other platforms. This wasn’t just a name. Formany it became part of their username, their handle, and their avatars/profilepictures which they switched to our adorable Shiba sporting a beret.Whether you are a new recruit or part of the old guard, if you fly under the Shibbanner, you must embrace our founding principles:1. We started from zero, with zero. It’s the spirit of our project to create somethingout of nothing.2. We were not founded from an existing community, let alone a preassembledteam. The brilliant minds behind Shib had never collaborated before. They were afresh team of developers, designers, moderators, marketers, and shillers. Whenyou joined the Shib army, from anywhere in the world, you found where yourtalents could be used best, and got to work.OUR BACKGROUNDv1 - 4/29/21 - WOOF Paper WWW.SHIBATOKEN.COM3. We love Shiba Inu Dogs.We are proud of where the Shib Army originated and equally excited for ourfuture. Our founder, Ryoshi, chose to start Shib from nothing, and gave thedirection of the currency to our army (which rapidly grew to be over 120,000+members strong).Starting with nothing means everyone has to bring something to the table.The holders and believers in our Shib Army have been the source of all our success.You and more than 120,000 fellow holders, admins, mods, leaders of internationalchat rooms, social media influencers, meme makers, shillers, and most of all,friends.THANK YOU. You are the real SHIBARMY, and we salute you.v1 - 4/29/21 - WOOF Paper WWW.SHIBATOKEN.COMWHY ETHv1 - 4/29/21 - WOOF Paper WWW.SHIBATOKEN.COMSHIBA RESCUEWITH AMAZON SMILEv1 - 4/29/21 - WOOF Paper WWW.SHIBATOKEN.COMTHE VISION OFSHIBASWAPv1 - 4/29/21 - WOOF Paper WWW.SHIBATOKEN.COMTHE STARTINGTOKENOMICS OFSHIBASWAPv1 - 4/29/21 - WOOF Paper WWW.SHIBATOKEN.COMWhen you BURY (Stake) tokens:The ShibaSwap Liquidity Pars (SSLP) are:These pools will then distribute rewards proportionally to holders of theaforementioned token pools.While the staked tokens receive a fixed percentage of BONE, the SSLP poolsare distributed as BPB (BONE per block) based on the allocation points toeach individual Puppy Pools.Furthermore, certain Puppy Pools are eligible for DOUBLE or even TRIPLEreturns!SHIB LEASH BONEShib-Eth SSLP Leash-Eth SSLP Bone-Eth SSLPSHIB LEASH BONExSHIB xLEASH tBONEv1 - 4/29/21 - WOOF Paper WWW.SHIBATOKEN.COMSHIBA ECOSYSTEMTOKENOMICSv1 - 4/29/21 - WOOF Paper WWW.SHIBATOKEN.COMYou get xSHIBBURY (Share of the Pool)3% BONEMinted per block0.3% All EthereumTransaction Fees+xSHIBPoolSHIBv1 - 4/29/21 - WOOF Paper WWW.SHIBATOKEN.COMYou getShib-Eth SSLP(Share of the Pool)DIGBones Minted per BlockSHIB-ETHPool SHIBv1 - 4/29/21 - WOOF Paper WWW.SHIBATOKEN.COM$LEASH INCENTIVESWhen STAKED, it generates xLEASH.xLEASH holders are part of the xLEASH POOL and will gain 0.5% of all BONE PerBlock (BPB).Moreover, to encourage LEASH Liquidity, the LEASH SSLP TOKEN Puppy Poolgathers 0.3% of all WBTC swap transactions and 0.3% of all USDC swaptransactions.In this case, LEASH SSLP TOKEN Puppy Pool triples staking returns.You get xLEASH(Share of the Pool) BURY0.5% BONEMinted per blockxLEASHPool LEASHYou getLeash-Eth SSLP(Share of the Pool)DIGBones Minted per Block+0.3% WBTC+0.3% USDCfrom all Swap transactionsLEASH-ETHPool LEASHv1 - 4/29/21 - WOOF Paper WWW.SHIBATOKEN.COMYou get tBONE(Share of the Pool) BURY1% BONEMinted per blockxBONEPool BONEv1 - 4/29/21 - WOOF Paper WWW.SHIBATOKEN.COMSHIBASWAPLIQUIDITY EVENTNOTE: Swap transactions are specifically for the token Swap function.You getBone-Eth SSLP(Share of the Pool)DIGBones Minted per Block+0.3% DAI+0.3% USDTfrom all Swap transactionsBONE-ETHPool BONEv1 - 4/29/21 - WOOF Paper WWW.SHIBATOKEN.COMv1 - 4/29/21 - WOOF Paper WWW.SHIBATOKEN.COMTHE GRRR LISTTHE FUTUREOF SHIBASWAPv1 - 4/29/21 - WOOF Paper WWW.SHIBATOKEN.COMv1 - 4/29/21 - WOOF Paper WWW.SHIBATOKEN.COMv1 - 4/29/21 - WOOF Paper WWW.SHIBATOKEN.COMCONCLUSIONThe Shiba community started with the seed of an idea. What could happen with nocentralized team, no funding, and no direct leadership? Could decentralizationactually work? Could we follow the perfect storm of digital currencies, like BTC orDOGE, except perpetuate something that is fully community-driven, instead?Now, while I do stay around and make it my mission to “defend the brand” andprotect the community from leeches and scammers, the volunteer team has doneamazing work and built the future of memecoin finance through ShibaSwap.This is the beginning of a new era for decentralized communities. When the time isright (because good things can't be rushed), ShibaSwap will be the crucial point ofcontact between the decentralized world and global communities, allowing us toactualize our vision of widespread adoption of DeFi cryptocurrency.Again, we would like to say thank you to each and every one of you. Without yourparticipation, none of this would be possible.It's time for us to begin.- Ryoshiv1 - 4/29/21 - WOOF Paper WWW.SHIBATOKEN.COMv1 - 4/29/21 - WOOF Paper WWW.SHIBATOKEN.COM
