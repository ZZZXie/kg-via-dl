We believe that decentralization holdsthe key to empowering people around the world to better safeguard theirrights, and that we are helping the world move in this direction by acceleratingthe transition to adopting cryptocurrency.Mission:Accelerate the World’s Transition to CryptocurrencyWe believe that by accelerating the transition to adopting cryptocurrency, wecan help people globally to:Control their money - ability to access their funds anytime and anywhere;Safeguard their data - cryptography-secured blockchain makes datatemperinghighly unlikely;Protect their identity - no central entity can compromise your identity.Vision:Cryptocurrency in Every WalletTM.In our journey to achieve this vision, we are:Redefining how money is being moved, spent and invested, andDemocratizing blockchain technology by designing beautiful, simple anduseful financial services that have a lasting, positive impact onpeople’s lives.Crypto.com 10Problem Statement and Our StrategyKey Challenges in Driving Crypto AdoptionWe see the following key challenges in driving crypto adoption:Our StrategyTo tackle the challenges above, we are offering products along 3 verticals:1. Payment2. Trading3. Financial ServicesOur strategy is to leverage payment solutionsas the primary tool for driving adoptionand user acquisition, while building tradingand financial services solutions as the majorsources of revenue. This strategy creates andself-sustains a virtuous cycle: payment channelsbring users onto the platform, whereas tradingand financial services generate revenue that canbe reinvested into payment.Our product solutions across three verticals are building up a sustainable ecosystemthat serves our mission: Accelerate the World’s Transition to Cryptocurrency.PaymentUser AcquisitionTrading &Financial ServicesRevenue EngineUser ExperienceValue PropositionPoorly designed user experience does not delightor satisfy mainstream usersWeak value propositions do not incentivize peopleto use crypto for purposes otherthan speculative tradingComplexity Di cult to understand andinvest for new-to-crypto usersSecurity Damaged user confidence from crypto-relatedfraud and theftCrypto.com 11Commitment to Security & ComplianceBuilding trust is the cornerstone of our commitment to our customers -we believe that security and compliance are the foundations of achievingmainstream cryptocurrency adoption.Crypto.com is the first cryptocurrency company in the world to have ISO/IEC27001:2013, ISO/IEC 27701:2019, PCI:DSS 3.2.1, Level 1 compliance and CCSS.ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Certification is the “Gold Standard”for privacy risk management (the audit was conductedby SGS, a leading inspection verification and certificationcompany recognized globally).ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Certification is the “Gold Standard”for information security management (the audit was ledby SGS, a global leader in Testing, Inspectionand Certification).PCI:DSS (Payment Card Industry: Data Security Standard)outlines a set of strict requirements set by the paymentcard industry and is designed to ensure that organizationswhich process, store or transmit credit card data maintaina highly secure environment, and uphold the highest datasecurity and privacy standards. Level 1 is the highest levelof certification.CCSS (Cryptocurrency Security Standard) covers a seriesof strict security requirements of an information systemthat stores, transacts with, or accepts cryptocurrenciesand applies to all information systems that make use ofcryptocurrencies, including exchanges, web applications,and cryptocurrency storage solutions.Crypto.com 12We have completed a detailed securityassessment, which included externalpenetration testing, threat modeling throughto risk control reviews. In addition to our ownextensive analysis, we have also engaged theKudelski Blockchain Security Center to conduct a thorough external securitytest and full threat modeling exercise to ensure the completeness of theirsecurity controls.We have also been rated “Adaptive (Tier 4)” – the highest level possible forthe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) CybersecurityFramework and the latest NIST Privacy Framework, developed by the USDepartment of Commerce. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework, originallyreleased in 2014, provides a framework of security guidance for how privatesector organizations can develop, assess and improve their ability to identify,protect, detect, respond and recover from cyber attacks.All of users’ cryptocurrencies are held offline in cold storage. Crypto.comhas secured a total of USD 360M in cold storage insurance against physicaldamage or destruction, and third-party theft.For more information on our security & compliance standards,please visit our website.Support of Fiat InstitutionsIn our journey to achieve the vision of Cryptocurrency in Every WalletTM, weare also actively enlisting the support of fiat institutions and helping them toinclude or involve cryptocurrency in their offerings in a compliant, secure &cost-effective manner.For example, one of the first products we have launched is the Visa Card asan approved VISA program manager. Cardholders can conveniently spend &withdraw the fiat equivalent of their cryptocurrency online or offline at 50+millions of VISA-approved merchants worldwide.As another case in point, our native blockchain solution - Crypto.org Chain- not only caters to retail users who want to spend any crypto anywhereCrypto.com 13Crypto.com Solutions OverviewBelow is an overview of the products we offer along three verticals:1.

It is also thetechnology that powers Crypto.com Pay, ourmobile payment solution (see section above),and will be used to revolutionize the world ofpayments, DeFi and NFT.Crypto.org Chain has the following key value propositions:1. Secure: Fault-tolerant design making the Chain resilient and safe;2. Instant & Low-Cost: Chain delivers Instant transaction confirmationcoupled with minimal fees;3. Permissionless: Chain is an open-sourced project that welcomes anyparty to join the network and/ or contribute to the code development.Roles & IncentivesDifferent parties will be able to join & use Crypto.org Chain with differentincentives:Crypto.com 23Roles in the network IncentivesTo make payments incryptocurrencyTo receive payments incryptocurrency MerchantsCustomersSettlementAgentsParticipantdiscounts: pay with crypto and receivegenerous cashback funded by the networkaccess (time): instant access to cryptocurrencyaccess (distribution): ability to spend cryptocurrencydirectly from their customer crypto-exchangeaccount / wallet at millions of merchants, bothonline or o ine,without moving to fiatreduced costs: zero processing fees;business growth: acquire high quality customerswith substantial spending power;marketing: oer customers network-fundeddiscounts and demonstrate abilityto move with anew trendTo settle between dierentcurrenciesrevenue: earn fees for activities performedValidators(Council Nodes)To validate and commit blocks(containing transaction info)to the chainrevenue: earn fees for activities performedTechnologyCrypto.org Chain Technology OverviewPlease refer to the Crypto.org Chain Documentation for an overview on latestreleases and features.More tools & information for developers could be found on theCrypto.org Chain website.Crypto.org Chain Croeseid MainnetCrypto.org Chain Mainnet launched in March 2021, with Crypto.org Coin (CRO)as its native currency.Users can stake CRO in Crypto.com DeFi Wallet to join delegated proof-ofstakeand earn yield accordingly.Crypto.com 24Crypto.org Chain Block ExplorerTo better share network information, Crypto.org Chain Explorer 2.0 was unveiledtogether with a revamped Crypto.org Chain website. By allowing anyone toreview the Croeseid Testnet on-chain activity, including node staking andgovernance, the new Crypto.org Chain Explorer marks an important milestone onour road to mainnet and supports our decentralized and permission-less visionfor the network.Tendermint as the Consensus EngineWe have decided to choose Tendermint - a byzantine fault tolerant (BFT)consensus protocol3 - as the consensus engine for Crypto.org Chain. We arealso an active contributor to the Tendermint Rust-abci library.The decision to use Tendermint was based on the following reasons amongothers:1. Solid performance in testinga. During our internal testing, we have obtained throughputs oftransactions-per-second (TPS) reaching hundreds;b. An earlier version of Tendermint was rigorously tested by Jepsen.io,which sets it apart from newly-proposed algorithms that are yet tobe thoroughly tested;2. Track record of adoption: Tendermint has been in continuousdevelopment since 2014, and has been adopted by several high-profileprojects4;3. Broad use cases: Unlike some blockchain systems that are confinedto consortium networks, Tendermint caters to both permissioned andpublic network;4. Flexibility: Tendermint has a fairly modular architecture, and offersflexibility on which and how applications are developed on top of it.3 See the Cosmos Whitepaper for detailsCrypto.com 25Network DecentralizationCrypto.org Chain is being built with complete decentralization in mind - Chainis a permissionless network, meaning that anyone can participate in thenetwork if they wish to do so. Crypto.org Chain is open-source on Github withdocumentation here.In the long-term, Crypto.org Chain will be able to run without CRO ProtocolLabs entities as we develop the key pieces of architecture and technology toenable it:Trust-less mechanisms to increase access to transaction validation nodes,Built-in and proven security protocols to keep bad actors at bay,Balanced incentives for valued added contributors and disincentives forfree-riders,Upgradability and flexibility of the chain through community codecontributions.4 See List of projects in Cosmos & Tendermint EcosystemCrypto.com 26Centralized vs Decentralized vs Distributed Network: An OverviewCentralized vs Decentralized vs Distributed Centralized NetworkAll the nodes areconnected under asingle authorityDecentralized NetworkNo single authority servercontrols the nodes, they allhave individual entityCrypto.com FiatCostSettlementNetworkFreeInstant2 - 3%T + 2 -> 7Network PotentialBlockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are relatively new concepts. SinceBitcoin’s initial release in 2009, the awareness and acceptance of blockchain& cryptocurrencies have been steadily on the rise. We are pleased to seethat crypto has received the interest and support of established institutions,with recent news such as Facebook’s launch of its Libra project and Paypal’sconfirmation that it is developing cryptocurrency capabilities. We believethat such favorable developments in the industry will continue to increase therecognition of cryptocurrencies and fuel the growth of the industry.On a related note, the accelerated experimentation of Central Bank DigitalCurrencies (CBDCs) by governments around the world indicate a stronginterest in digital currencies as a whole. Our research & insights team havesupported The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) in a white paper titledDigimentality —Fear and Favouring of Digital Currency, which outlines thefindings from our research on consumer attitudes towards digital currencies.We have observed that 85% of survey respondents have owned, used orheard of decentralized digital currency (such as a cryptocurrency), indicatingincreased public awareness.Crypto.com 27Another indicator on the potential of cryptocurrencies is the exponentialgrowth in the number of wallets. Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet creation haveexperienced explosive growth (>10x) respectively from 2013 to 2015 and 2016to 2018. We expect wallet creation growth to continue in the future but witha significantly more moderate CAGR down to 30-40% in the later years. Ourresearch & insights team have used on-chain data to reach the estimate thatthe Bitcoin & Ethereum wallet addresses map to around 66 million cryptoowners worldwide in 2020 (see this report for details on methodology), whichis a sizable user-base considering both networks are around or less than adecade old at the time of the estimate.Historical growth of Bitcoin and Ethereum WalletLeveraging the Bitcoin/Ethereum wallet creation growth forecast, anddiscounting users with multiple wallets as well as overlap between eachblockchain wallets, we expect crypto users to grow to 250 to 400 millions by20225.____________________________________________________________5 Based on historical growth of Bitcoin and Ethereum wallets (2:1 ratio in contribution) and decreasingexpected future growth down to 35% in the last yearBitcoin Wallet Address Growth60,000,00040,000,00020,000,0001/1/2012 1/1/2014 1/1/2016 1/1/2018 1/1/20200# of addressess on the Bitcoin networkEthereum Wallet Address Growth100,000,00075,000,00050,000,00025,000,0001/1/2016 1/1/2017 1/1/2018 1/1/2019 1/1/20200# of addressess on the Ethereum networkCrypto.com 28Total Digital Payments segment expected to be $5+ trillion USD by 2022,amongst which crypto payments could represent 2-3%7 of total paymentvolume ($100-150 billion USD).in million USDTotal Transaction Value in the "Digital Payments" Segment66,000,0004,000,0002,000,0002016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 20222,311,40702,753,7143,265,2093,818,9094,381,4014,920,4685,411,354Source: Statista Digital Commerce Mobile POS Payments_____________________________________________________________5 Based on historical growth of Bitcoin and Ethereum wallets (2:1 ratio in contribution) and decreasingexpected future growth down to 35% in the last year6 The Digital Payments market segment is led by consumer transactions and includes payments for productsand services which are made over the Internet as well as mobile payments at point-of-sale (POS) viasmartphone applications.7 Similar to the payment market penetration of the first mobile payment player entrant in a large marketafter 4-5 yearsCrypto.com 29Visa CardValue PropositionCustomers typically face the following pain points when trying to buy & spendwith cryptocurrencies:1. Lack of places to transact with crypto;2. Having to endure long lead times (3-4 days) for processing;3. Being charged significant FX fees (up to 5% of purchase amount) byfinancial institutions when spending abroad with regular fiat debit orcredit cards.The Visa Card addresses these pain points by allowing cardholders to:A.
